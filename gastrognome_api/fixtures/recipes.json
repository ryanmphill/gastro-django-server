        "prep_instructions": "Preheat the oven to 425°F. \nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside until ready to use.\n\nMix the dry ingredients:\nIn a large bowl, use your fingertips to rub the lemon zest into the sugar, infusing the sugar with the oils from the lemon zest. \n\nAdd the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda and whisk to combine.\n\nCut in the butter:\nAdd the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture, tossing with your hands to distribute and coat the butter in flour. Using a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture forms coarse crumbs and the butter is in pieces no larger than a pea.\n\nIf you don’t have a pastry blender, use the tips of your fingers to squish the butter into the flour, pressing and breaking the butter into pea-sized pieces, but flat, not in chunks.\n\nAdd the wet ingredients:\nMeasure the buttermilk in a liquid measuring cup, then whisk in the egg. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture. Gently fold the mixture together with a rubber spatula or plastic dough scraper until it forms a cohesive, but crumbly mass. Don't overmix. It's okay if the dough is slightly lumpy or a few dry bits remain.\n\nShape and divide:\nTransfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Use your hands to gently knead the dough a few times, then press the dough into an 8-inch diameter disk about 1 1/2 inches thick. Use a long knife or a bench scraper to cut the disk into 8 equal-sized wedges.\n\nPlace the wedges on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them at least 1-inch apart. Use a pastry brush to brush the tops of the scones lightly with buttermilk.\n\nChill:\nPlace the baking tray in the freezer and chill for 15 minutes.\n\n",
        "cook_instructions": "Bake:\nBake the scones in the center of the oven until golden on top and browned underneath, about 20 minutes. Allow the scones to cool completely on the pan before adding the lemon glaze.\n\nMake the lemon glaze:\nWhile the scones cool, make the lemon glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until the glaze is smooth.\n\nGlaze the scones:\nUse a spoon to drizzle the scones with the lemon glaze. Allow the glaze to set for 10 minutes, then serve.",

        "note": "You want to use very cold butter diced into 1/2-inch cubes. If you have time you should cut the butter and freeze it for at least 30 minutes before mixing the dough.\n\nAvoid overmixing the dough. The dough should be pretty crumbly and it’s absolutely fine if there are a few floury or dry spots. If you overmix the dough, the scones can get tough and will lose some of their flakiness.\n\nFor the flakiest scones that won’t lose their shape as much during baking, chill the shaped scones in the freezer before baking for at least 15 minutes while the oven preheats.\n\nStorage:\nThe scones will keep in an airtight container on the counter for up to two days. For longer storage, the scones can be frozen for up to two months in a freezer bag. Let the scones defrost at room temperature for about 1 hour before eating.",

Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 8 to 9 minutes, or until the broccoli is brighter green and just starting to turn golden on the edges.\n\nAdd the cumin and cinnamon to the skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the spinach, a few handfuls at a time, stirring until it has reduced in size. Repeat with remaining spinach and cook until all of the spinach has wilted.\n\nTransfer the contents of the pan to a medium mixing bowl. Add the drained beans, ¼ cup cheese and a drizzle of enchilada sauce (about 2 tablespoons). Season with ½ teaspoon salt and some freshly ground black pepper, to taste.\n\nAssemble the enchiladas: Pour ¼ cup enchilada sauce into your prepared pan and tilt it from side to side until the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. To assemble your first enchilada, spread ½ cup filling mixture down the middle of a tortilla, then snugly wrap the left side over and then the right, to make a wrap. Place it seam side down against the edge of your pan. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.\n\nDrizzle the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the enchiladas, leaving the tips of the enchiladas bare. Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese evenly over the enchiladas.\n\nBake, uncovered, on the middle rack for 20 minutes. If the cheese on top isn’t golden enough for your liking, carefully transfer the enchiladas to the upper rack of the oven and bake for an additional 3 to 6 minutes, until sufficiently golden and bubbly.\n\nRemove from oven and let the enchiladas rest for 10 minutes (they’re super hot!).
